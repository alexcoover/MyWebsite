            <h3>Film Score Demo Reel 2022</h3>
            <p>
                A(n outdated) collection of some of my works. The majority of these films were completed in less than 48 hours - in cooperation with the 48 hour film festival. By the time I receive the film I have roughly 4 hours to deliver a score. I will eventually create a new reel, but until then viewing the films below or the <a href="compositions.html">compositions</a> will be more relevant.

            <p>
                A peek inside one of the projects I did sound design for. I was delivered a 25 minute long silent film and built the sound from the ground up. Footsteps, head scratches, chair creeks, you name it. The sounds are then shepherded through the appropriate room reverb channel.

            <h3>Movie Night</h3>
            <p>
                A stylized film created in collaboration with the founders of the NWCC Film Noir Festival. This project was very context dependent on score which lead to composing an albums worth of big band jazz songs as well as a classical score for the dramatic ending.

            <h3>Come In, Stranger</h3>
            <p>
                Taking place centuries ago, Come In, Stranger is a tale of a witch seeking her revenge. The score is primarily dozens of layers of subtly evolving textures which allows for the women's choir to stand out. For the dream sequence I de-tuned a harp then play it back at half speed.

                A futuristic story with heart-wrenching twist. This is a submission for the Musicbed 30 day Film challenge, a music licensing platform. The requirements included using 30 seconds of a song from their library, in our case the final 30 seconds of the film.

            <p>
                This Si-Fi short was a part of the 48 hour film festival, winning several awards including best musical score. Completed in about four hours, I made the sounds primarily with synthesizers including my analog modular synth.

            <p>
                It's the summer of 1984, and love is in the air accompanied by 17 minutes of blistering hot summer ambience. I built every sound, every brush of clothing, every cricket chirp, except for dialogue and score. I also delivered the final mix on this award winning film.

                Murders are popping up all over town, or are they suicides? 25 minutes of captivating sound design done by yours truly, as well as the final mix. This film is the extended version of Death Wish, which I scored. The first two minutes of music are made by me, taken from its predecessor.

            <p>
                After a home invasion, a woman takes matters in into her own hands. This is one of the first film projects that I worked on. Again I am responsible for sound design, score, and final mix.
